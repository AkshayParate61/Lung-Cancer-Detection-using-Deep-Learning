# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project is a web app that uses deep learning to detect lung cancer from chest X-rays or CT scans. Built with Flask for the backend and TensorFlow/Keras for prediction, it allows users to upload medical images and receive predictions, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing lung cancer.
